In a four-week project, students in the first year _Digital Prototyping_ course engaged with the [UN Sustainability Goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs) and notions of speculative design, discursive design and design fiction.

The goal was to generate knowledge in and through a speculative design approach, utilising digital materials and prototyping techniques around a chosen theme of sustainable development. People outside the design process were also engaged with, to evaluate how the designed artifacts were "working" as discursive design.

Students were asked to avoid:
* One-liners: projects which hinge on a simplistic or superficial perspective of sustainability
* _Black Mirror_ rejects: dramatic, dystopian futures lacking subtlety or openness for questioning/interpretation
* A better mousetrap: the concepts and artifacts produced in the design work are not supposed to embody a solution

_Greta_ proposes a shoulder-mounted audio shroud which gives constant audio feedback on the sustainability impact of products around you. Reflecting that sustainability is multi-dimensional and individuals care about different factors, an app allows the user to change a filter. For example, distinguishing products by how far away they were produced, their total carbon footprint and so on.

_Strawmore_ recasts cheap, disposable plastic straws as luxury goods. Straws  bought for conspicuous consumption and collecting and made of exotic materials. Physical mock-ups were made alongside an online shopping experience.
