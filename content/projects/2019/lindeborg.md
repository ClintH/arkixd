In the field of interaction- and user experience design, there is an important correlation between experience and memory. The aspect of a positive impression and memory design is becoming increasingly important in a world in which interactive solutions are competing to keep users’ attention, and to persuade users to maintain their interest in a specific product. To design for a positive memory or relatedness in a sign-up process could be the first crucial step for a user to become a loyal and returning customer. To create relatedness and a positive memory of your solution/product could be the difference between users continuing using it or moving to the next one, resulting in success or failure for your service or product. 

The aim of my thesis project was to explore how different design elements, such as tonality of language, UI-elements, narrative imagery and historical newspaper frontpage from the user’s own date of birth, could form a positive memory of a sign-up process for the newspaper Sydsvenskan.

I did this by sketching out and creating three different interactive prototypes with personalized sequenced trigger elements. I used these prototypes in an explorative way to conduct usability and user experience research to understand what people actually remember over time.

## Results

In short my result was exciting and also surprising. It showed that with small means it is possible to design an experience that travels from the main purpose of a sign-up transaction to the user experiencing friendliness and relatedness with a product or service. This means that design actually affect people’s memories in certain ways intended.
