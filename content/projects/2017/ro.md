_Ro_ is a playful artefact based on the experience of a physical spinning top. In our analysis, we found that a regular top has a hypnotising quality with its seemingly perpetual spinning. While you're in control when launching the spinner, after that, it seems to have a life of its own and you are drawn into watching how it unfolds.
