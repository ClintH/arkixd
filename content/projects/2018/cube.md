C.U.B.E is a screen based digital game which explores the challenges of navigating a 3-D space from a 2-D perspective with the aid of a physical cube-shaped controller.

In C.U.B.E, you play as an early-staged planet whose purpose is to collect resources of different resources such as rock, air and water in order to evolve into a strong and healthy planet. These resources appear as spheres with unique colors based on the resource they represent and drifts towards you from various directions. Each side of the cube also has a unique color identical to the spheres. The objective is to catch spheres with the matching color of the sides of the cube (i.e catch a blue sphere with the blue side of the cube).
