Chatbots have been around for decades but haven’t really gained a lot of attention until very recently. With new advancements in the technologies of artificial intelligence and natural language processing, chatbots have very quickly gained the interest of commercial businesses. What seems to be lacking, though, is a user perspective on the subject of chatbots. This thesis explores how customers of Swedbank in the segment of 18 – 35 perceives Swedbank's current chatbot service, Nina, and the perception of the resulting concept that was developed based on empirical findings, Nina 2.0. The findings conclude among other things that chatbots with a clear and simple goal was positively received by the users, and interaction through preprogrammed answering buttons resulted in expressions of relief as the users did not have to worry about miscommunication with the chatbot.
