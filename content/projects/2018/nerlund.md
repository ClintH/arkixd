The benefit of a self-service technology (SST) is often for the companies, needing less employees when the customers can perform the service by themselves. But an SST might not always benefit the customer or employees experience. However, there are certain attributes that motivates customers to use SSTs and sometimes preferring them over service staff. This research explores how to design an SST with the aim of improving the overall service experience, for both the service customers and its employees at a mid-range hotel. By involving the stakeholders in the design process using co-creative methods, opportunities for improving their existing service was identified. Concepts were developed in co-creative workshops, and prototypes were designed and tested using interaction design principles. The final design was an SST kiosk that shows potential of improving the experience for customers and employees at the hotel.
