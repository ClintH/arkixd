The present research regarding aesthetics of interaction have primarily focused on interactions based on bodily movement. After conducting a literature review of aesthetics of interacting with smart home devices through voice control it was obvious that there is a need for conducting experiments with aesthetics in verbal communication. In this study I did various experiments tweaking and manipulating the way in which we communicate verbally as well as the act of listening. For example, "How would it feel to talk to my smart assistant in a therapeutic way?".
