Many deaf and hard-of-hearing students struggle in group educational settings due to challenges following conversations. This project introduces the design of Augmented Reality (AR) glasses, which are made to improve communication for deaf and hearing-impaired people. It is supposed to minimize information overload and promote active participation. The glasses offer two key features to improve communication: real-time captioning and sign language avatars. Real-time captions with speech bubbles around the speaker, that the user is focused on, dynamically appear, making it easier to follow even multi-person discussions. Color-coding and "listening" signals further enhance clarity. The introduction of real-time sign-language avatars is for sign-language users. These avatars translate spoken language into gestures, displayed near the speaker's head. Focused presentation of real-time captioning and sign-language avatars ensures clear comprehension of the conversation flow. By using AR technology, this initiative goes beyond simple technological innovation. Its design aims to break down communication barriers and promote a more inclusive learning environment by including setting preferences in the app.
