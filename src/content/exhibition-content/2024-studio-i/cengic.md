Interruptions in the office can cause negative feelings when they happen at inconvenient times. Current strategies to access someone’s availability involve relying on visual cues which can be misinterpreted and cause missed information.

To help the  interrupter make informed decisions before interrupting, an ambient lamp will convey the colleagues’ availability through text and light. The lamp activates itself only through implicit interaction when using head movements and when approaching the lamp. The pictures show the code showcasing the interaction and the physical prototype.
