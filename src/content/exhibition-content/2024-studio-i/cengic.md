Interruptions in the office can cause negative feelings if they happen at inconvenient times. Current strategies for assessing someone’s availability involve relying on visual cues, which can be misinterpreted or lead to false assumptions about a colleague's availability.

To help office workers make informed decisions before interrupting, an ambient lamp will convey a colleague’s availability through text and light. The lamp activates itself only through implicit interaction, such as when someone looks over a colleague's desk or approaches the lamp.
