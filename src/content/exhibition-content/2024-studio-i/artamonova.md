This project explores the concept of integrating storytelling into the experience of offline vintage shopping. Sharing stories about clothes contributes to forming a bond with them from the beginning. By recognizing the strong hedonic sense of vintage shopping, the concept uses it to strengthen the emotional connection to the piece with narratives. The proposed solution is a more immersive changing room experience with the story being told on the mirror while the user is trying a garment on. The solution is using the technology of NFC stickers that would be on clothing tags and scanned in the allocated place in the changing room.
During the design process, I was exploring how to:
- Subtly integrate technology into the process
- Avoid making users stay on their phones while browsing through the clothes
- Design a solution that would fit different shopping routines (quick or slow)
