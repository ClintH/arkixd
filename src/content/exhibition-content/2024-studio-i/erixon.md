Museums are often visited in groups, but exhibits are not always designed to accommodate this. How can interactive technology be implemented to support and encourage social engagement? 

The project explored interaction through physical objects that could be passed around and placed. Using a large table to gather around, encouraging movement and cooperation, intentionally spreading out information and interaction zones.

A shared experience is one motivator for group visitors to museums. The concept seeks to provide that directly through play, but also linking to the overall museum visit. Topics specific to the groupâ€™s background was tested, contrasting with generic ones, as well as collaborative play contrasting competitive game setups.
