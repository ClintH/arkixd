"Creatively Flawed" is an online feedback tool for digital drawing, designed to incentivize ongoing conversations on skillset improvement between art teachers and students. Inspired by differential tools used in programming, it relies on image segmentation technology to generate individual PNGs from a bitmap graphic, enabling targeted assessment. Professors can comment, sketch, or add pictures directly on the newly created PNGs, offering suggestions and guidance. Simultaneously, students can respond with further iterations or by requesting additional advice. The result is an interactive canvas that resembles a collage, visualizing instances of the learning process. The following interaction facilitates both self-assessment and formative assessments on behalf of the professors.
