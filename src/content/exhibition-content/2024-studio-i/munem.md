Modern communication tools like video calls and chatting are valuable for enabling visual and verbal interaction, but they often lack the tangible sense of shared energy that comes with being physically present during communication.

Even simple acts like feeling or hearing your partner's heartbeat can create a deeply intimate connection, evoking a sense of something uniquely special shared with your partner.

When one partner touches the device, it sends a gentle vibration to the other person, symbolizing "I'm thinking about you." If both individuals touch the device, they can share real-time heartbeats and feel them through vibrations. This can enrich their communication.
