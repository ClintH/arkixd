When horse lungeing, handlers face challenges that hinder desirable training outcomes. A key contributing factor to this is the overlooking of scientific theories, which has shown that the placement of the handler’s hands, and the environment affecting the horse psychologically, play major roles in training outcomes. 

During prior research, it was investigated if AR with the help of artificial intelligence could help handlers overcome these mistakes. This was done by providing real-time feedback based on equine theory and analyzing the handlers and the horse's body movement. It was concluded that AR applications are feasible for addressing these issues, however, it was also highlighted that the limiting factors of AR need to be carefully considered.

Following feedback from stakeholders, two prototypes were pursued. The first is an AR headset, and the second uses a camera paired with headphones and haptics. The outcomes of this project show that the second vibration-controlled haptics prototype worked better for test users, providing them with interactive and intuitive feedback.

In contrast, the AR-headset prototype did not yield positive feedback, making users feel insecure about their surroundings due to AR’s limited field of view.
