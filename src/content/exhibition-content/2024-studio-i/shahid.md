The project presents a digital scale prototype with a non-numerical design, aimed to assist users with dyscalculia in the kitchen. Many traditional measuring tools can be challenging and overwhelming for individuals with dyscalculia due to the numbers. This concept replaces the number of grams with a graph, providing clear visual indicators to ensure accurate measurements. The graph represented by a green circle the rotates according to the weight on the scale. When the user adds extra ingredients, the graph turns red to indicate an excess amount of ingredients. The approach simplifies the process when baking, making it more enjoyable and allowing individuals with dyscalculia to focus on baking.
