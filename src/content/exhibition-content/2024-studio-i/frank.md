Creating prototypes that can give the user the feeling of a final product can be challenging for designers when they have time constraints. The main goal of this project was to explore how 3D printing with conductive filaments can enable a quick and effective way for designers to create electronic prototypes and observe how users interact with different interfaces. By 3D printing a lamp and multiple interfaces, I was able to discover a userâ€™s interaction with shapes and designs they might have not encountered before. The project provides a way for users to freely explore the interface, without the additional guidelines of the designer.
