This project delves into various approaches to gesture controls for adjusting 
lighting on a bathroom mirror. The prototypes developed aimed to create new 
methods of interacting with illumination. Depending on the individual we all have different body
care routines. The scope of the project aims to provide better accessibility for lighting 
control when youâ€™re hands are busy brushing your teeth, applying skin-care, 
or washing your hands.
