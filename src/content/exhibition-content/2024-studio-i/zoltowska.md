Poetry's abstract nature often makes it challenging to connect with emotionally, limiting its accessibility. To address this, I propose a device that integrates touch sensors into a poetry book. As readers trace verses with their fingers, these sensors create vibrations reflecting the poem's emotions and rhythm. This multi-sensory experience aims to make the complexities of poetry more accessible, allowing readers to not only see and hear but also feel its emotional nuances. By enhancing engagement and understanding, this project seeks to revitalize poetry's relevance and emotional resonance.
