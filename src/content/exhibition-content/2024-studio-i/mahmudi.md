In this project I initially explored the integration of journaling into everyday objects, addressing a gap identified during my literature review. Digital and traditional journaling tools were well documented but not everyday objects. This idea was driven by my target group, people who want to journal but struggle to find the time.

With three diverse objects used as probes - a mug, a pillow and a mirror - I was able to analyse their various proporties and relations. Through interviews I learned that journaling is less about documenting information and more about reflecting emotions and situations. Interviewees expressed they rerely revisited their old journal entries.
 
The _Heartbeat Mug_ aims to create a routine for inner reflection, helping users shift from a stressful mindset to a calmer state. The mug features a haptic heartbeat sensation, encouragining users to connect to their inner selves. A capacitive thread is threaded around the mug sleeve to detect touch and trigger the vibrations mimicking a heartbeat.
