Due to various reasons, such as time management or social anxiety, it might not always be possible for a bouldering beginner to go climb with a friend or a partner. However, during my research, many beginners expressed that climbing alone is unfulfilling as there is no one to share your success with and get help from. Therefore, I created an AR app for those lonely climbs, that offers helpful tips and tricks as well as cheers on the beginner. On top of that, it offers animations of how to climb a route as many boulderers expressed how useful a visualization can be. However, they also mentioned that how one climber approaches a route can differ drastically, making them even more confused. Therefore, I opted for an animatated visualization to promote problem solving. Moreover, the app offers an overview of how many routes the climber finished depending on difficulty as well as the number of attempts so they can keep track of their progress.
