The project explored the use of tangibles for 3D view manipulations to better align the user's mental model with their actions. The design opportunity came from the limitations of the mouse, which fails to offer proper 3D interaction for creative work. The research evidenced the user preference for tangibles, given their inherent intuitive nature, but also argued for the mouse since it is accurate and familiar. Therefore, both types of inputs were leveraged through a hybrid system.

I chose to focus on view manipulation considering the lack of coordination between input and output. A tangible addressed this by navigating the 3D scene in a way that is physically sensed, thereby bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds. Ultimately, the relevance of adding a tangible to the workspace was to address the mismatch between perceiving and sensing, while reducing the mental demand and improving the user-experience. 

The prototype is based on the orbiting metaphor, featuring a smaller sphere to help the user 'gravitate' around the 3D scene. This device is meant to be used with the non-dominant hand, allowing users to work simultaneously with the mouse on other tasks.
