Let's play is an attempt to create a design solution for the game Yahtzee so it can be played in a remote setting without losing the social and the physical game experience achieved in a traditional face-to-face play and without requiring any complex or expensive technology. The prototype consists of a desktop application and a physical artifact. It enables multiple players to see each other and the game material simultaneously. Testing shows that it is possible to design for remote play but still have an equivalent experience to face-to-face play.
