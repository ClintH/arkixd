This project focuses on how two individuals are able to communicate through touch and haptic feedback when being apart from each other. Through user testing with different stakeholders living in a long distance relationship with their partner, insights about the project's look and feel have been brought up. The results were two necklaces being connected to each other, both containing a vibrator and a pressure pad. When the user touches their own necklace, the other necklace starts vibrating and making it possible for them to communicate with haptic feedback through the necklace.
