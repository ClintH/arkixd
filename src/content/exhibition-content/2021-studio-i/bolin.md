Social connection for youth that participate in sports team is great value to create an everyday interactive environment of support. When sports team are not able to meet physically, social connection decreases. The double diamond method has been used, to go through the process of research, user tests, and design to create a new platform for social connection over distance. The final design is conducted in form of a video call with a voice recognition and vibrating actuators, that will demonstrate the physical touch. This design makes it possible to maintain an interactive environment of support and positive feedback for youth in sports team over physical distance.
