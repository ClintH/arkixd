Developed as part of an exploration into embodied interactions/somaesthetics. The BabyOrb was meant to emotionally connect parents to be, focusing on family constellations where the parents don't live together. A birth mother and a couple would for example both have an orb that, when touched, communicate with the other orb, showing interest and comfort for the parent at the other end.
