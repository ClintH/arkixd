Rather than designing for ease of use, what if we designed for the progressive development of technique and mastery?

In this three-week module, students explored the notions of skill through the material of a humble analog joystick.

In the course <em>Interactivity</em>, students purposefully do not create concepts or solve problems, they are engaged with pure experimentation and building knowledge through design. A large quantity of sketches are produced, here we draw out a handful.

# Two-handed manipulation
## Julia Brandt & Hafsa Mire

Inspired by the two-handed working of dough, the sketches explored working with two joysticks and how their combined used can manipulate a cursor.

# Elastic
## Benjamin Dannegård & Alison Thomas

Rather than direct bodily contact with the joysticks, a series of sketches explored manipulating the joystick through an elastic intermediary.

# Extension
## Marri Dragicevic & Kaylin Lee

By mounting the joystick on the floor and introducing a long rod, moving the joystick becomes a matter of reaching and pulling the whole upper-body.

# Bimodal
## Alexander Grövnes & Robin Schritter

Inspired by guitar playing, the sketches explored interaction that involved both hands and arms but each in a distinctive way and relation to the body.

# Grip
## Josefine Hansson & Aleena Singh

Shown here is a series of explorations in different kinds of grips that can be designed for.

# Challenge
## Johan Hellgren & Helena Winkler

The notion being explored is creating interaction that can be learned and skill developed. In this case, using a simple walking simulation, precise coordination is required to make the figure move.

# Tonal
## Ellen Mårtensson & Karl Söderby

In these experiments, sound was controlled by angular movement of the grip. A question driving the work was whether musical progressions could flow from the interaction.
