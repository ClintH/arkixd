# As a speaker

Insights
* Can produce audio, although at low volume
* Sound quality acceptable
* Flexible and soft

# As a microphone

Insights
* Very noisy, low gain
* Voices can be discerned
* Works well to detect impact

# As a sensing glove

Insights
* Capacitive touch sensing yields direct touch, presence, in principle pressure
* Resistive sensing yields twisting, bending, stretching, in principle a sliding potentiometer

# Future work

* Affordances & aesthetic qualities of each form have not been fully explored
* Situating forms (and insights) in concrete use cases
