As more of our lives inhabit digital spaces, long-distance friendships proliferate. Time zone differences and conflicting schedules make it difficult for distance friends to find time to play video games together. This project is concerned with bringing the convenience of asymmetrical communication to the experience of playing video games. The goal is to create a sense of presence with long-distance friends to enhance the shared experience of playing the same games, even when playing alone.

Users will be able to send short audio messages to their friends within games they both play. When User A says something they wish to send to their friend they will press their selected hotkey and send recorded audio of the last 10-60 seconds picked up by their microphone. When User B reaches the same moment in their game, they will hear the message sent to them by User A.

As a built-in feature for existing video games platforms like Playstation 5, Steam, and Nintendo Switch, the commentary system would need to be seamlessly integrated into the UI for each platform. I explored the specifics of each interface to include options for commentary at the system and individual game levels.

The experience was simulated with users who claimed it changed how they talk while playing, made the single player experience more fun, and felt like playing together.
