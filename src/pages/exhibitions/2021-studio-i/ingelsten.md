"Where is:" is an application that is meant to augment and aid in emotional communication in long distance relationships, whether they are romantic or not. Prototypes and the final design were closely co-designed with couples that have been in long distance relationships. Through discussions about intimacy, relationships, and the different stresses that arise through long distances, methods of interaction and design came forth.
The design itself is based on the notion of a “Minimal Virtual Intimate Object” by Joseph “Jofish” Kaye whereby the limitations and low fidelity of the design allow for rich interaction between people. Several designs were sketched and co-designed before the final application, “Where is:”, was decided upon. Through this design I wanted to explore the possibilities and intricacies that exist within the realm of low-bandwidth communication and intimate communication.

“Where is:” allow people to locate the direction and location of a loved one and then send dots that appear on the other's screen, which they then can send back. The dots are accompanied by vibrations. There are three screen variations that show the status of your and the other persons direction:

1. The other person is looking at you which makes the screen slightly lighter.
2. You are near the correct direction. White bars appear at the sides of the screen and the
screen becomes a lighter hue
3. You are looking directly at the other person. White bars encompass the whole screen
and it turns orange.

Through this interaction a sense of everyday presence can be felt and experienced even at a distance thus allowing people to feel a closer connection.
