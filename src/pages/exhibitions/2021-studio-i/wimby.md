Today, time is of high currency. Watching a movie with the family is an activity where we share and enjoy the time together. But due to different reasons, families can get separated and technology becomes the connection between us. This project explores how we can share the experience of watching a movie when we canâ€™t be in the same location, and how to create a space where we feel connected. Interacting with each other, and with the program, combined with the saving of the memory, can make us feel as if the moment was not spent alone but together with the family.
