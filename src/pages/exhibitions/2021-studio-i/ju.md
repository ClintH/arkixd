The senior population is growing and they play casual games on mobile devices as a preferred pastime. Despite the increasing trend, there are not enough games developed for the older demographics. In this study, I have explored how the game interfaces can be utilised as a space to afford users a way of interacting. I have tested multiple iterations to develop user-flows and GUI elements that support users in performing a task in the game. Through these activities, I have drawn insights regarding how to improve usability and accessibility of mobile games for older adults.

[The project is available online.](https://xd.adobe.com/view/644da440-466d-412c-a4e4-3186e1753087-311e/?fullscreen) I recommend using desktop browsers to avoid Adobe XDâ€™s inherent limitations.
