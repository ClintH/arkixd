Living in a long-distance relationship is a common aspect of nowadays life. Even though intimacy is a key ingredient for maintaining relationships, physical separation becomes a barrier to meaningful everyday interaction and the use of mobile interpersonal communication technologies becomes necessary. In this project, the potential of sound as a material is explored and awareness is created to the so often neglected auditory sense. Through the interchange of one's acoustic environment, intimacy and presence can be transmitted between dyads and telepresence possibilities are probed, tightening the bond between the digital and the physical worlds.
