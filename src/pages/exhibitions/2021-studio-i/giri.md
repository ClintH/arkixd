The Covid outbreak has highlighted the importance of touch. The technologies used, for connecting with people, these days all rely solely on hearing and sight. We have not yet made effective use of sense of touch. So, in this project I have attempted to mediate touch, creating a device which I call Hapti-Touch. The sensation of touch is achieved using small vibration motor. The grid of these vibration motors is then connected to Arduino via Monostable. This grid is then placed inside the glove. Ideally, the input of the vibration would come from the other person or interaction. In this project I have focused on the interaction aspect of output of vibration.  

There are three different touches coded in this particular project. Single tap on different part. A gentle stroke and holding of the hand. A tap was 0.5 sec vibration on a specific part. A hold was simultaneous vibration on all the vibration motors. A stroke was vibration starting from left and ending at right. The functional prototype was then made and tested out. When users tested it out, there was a visual element on the screen that displayed a video of touching hand synchronous to the vibration feedback. The project was successful in demonstrating the capability of using vibration motors to simulate a social touch in a satisfactory level.
