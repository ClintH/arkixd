My goal for this project was to promote curiosity and also offer cognitive and sensory enrichment in wildlife, to give control over an aspect of ones surrounding nature that was both easy to use and fulfilling for both human and wildlife parties. Research provided insight as to the living conditions and poor hygiene feeders can accumulate, therefore augmenting the risk creating a breeding ground for avian diseases. Birds have had their own social distancing woes with diseases such as Trichomonosis & Salmonella as the hobby of feeding wild birds is on the rise. 

This is an exploration of the following questions:
- How can humans create an optimized feeding area for their beloved wild friends? 
- Would the birds accept technology around their feeders?
- What sorts of interactions can create a personifying (one way)bond between human and animal? 
- Can a design instill new habits if the feedback is rewarding enough?
