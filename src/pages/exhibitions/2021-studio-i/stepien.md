There are thousands of resources for learning a language. Apps and websites give endless possibilities to grasp any language in the world. Many people dive in and simply get lost, they give up or get annoyed because it isn’t for them. They want to learn but don’t know how.

The app #LANGUAGEBRAIN is there to help these people find the most optimal method of learning a language by using their natural predispositions. Firstly, they do the test which indicates which brain hemisphere is dominant. Scientists and psychologists described characteristics of brain dominance and how it works. Based on that knowledge, the app describes to the user what are their strongest skills and determines which tools, methods, online resources are the best for a person taking the test. It also suggests apps which have the highest chance of enhancing language learning experience. That way, people can start learning quicker and with right tools for them.
