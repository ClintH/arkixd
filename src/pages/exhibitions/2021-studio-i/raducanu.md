This project deals with solving the issues that arise from social isolation among teenagers during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The main problem that arose from this situation was that although teenagers were bored and felt the need to engage in leisure activities, the feeling of social isolation made them apathetic and spent most of their time using their phones while laying in bed, which generated feelings of guilt and anger. Therefore I tried solving this problem by introducing a means of suggesting activities to teenagers while encouraging social interaction with their peers, thus increasing their motivation and keeping them entertained. This platform uses a gamification method in which the user spins a ‘Wheel of Activities’ and receives randomized challenges meant to help them increase their drive to do productive and fun activities.
