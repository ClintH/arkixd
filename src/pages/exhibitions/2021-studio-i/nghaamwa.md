Con-text, is messaging App that gives context to users about the person who sends them a messages at the time they send the message. It uses the GPS location of users to determine their environmental context, and users manually update their mood within the app. The app is designed to enhance the ability of users to empathise with the people they are texting by providing them with information about the sender’s weather, local time, location and mood.

By making users contextually aware of each other, and ultimately able to be more empathetic, users should be able to understand and pick appropriate response better. The information is displayed in simple and understandable manner for users, furthermore, the interface was designed with the users’ preferences in mind.

Con-text allows users to customise what they share, and with whom they share. The privacy settings allow users a range of ways for users to customise how they share their settings. Users can select to edit what they share for all profile, or hand pick induvial profiles, or edit what they share within the chats. The settings are easy to understand, and navigate, retaining all the power into the user.

A little Con-text goes a long way!
