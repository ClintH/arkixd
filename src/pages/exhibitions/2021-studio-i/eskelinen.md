During a global pandemic, many families have kept in touch remotely through video calls. Relationships between adults can be well maintained through joint conversations, but managing emotional bonds between children and adults is more difficult. In a normal environment with children, an emotional bond is formed by creating shared memories, continuity of contact and playfull activities. Losing touch to a child is emotionally difficult especially for close adults, and often long periods of separation lead to a weakening of emotional bond from the part of the child.

Maintaining children’s interest during video calls is difficult for adults because it is unnatural for a child to communicate via computer or phone. The child often does not recognize where to look and talk to, activities are limited due to the difficulty of moving equipment, and the adult sees only a small portion of the child’s personality during short sessions. Adults feel excluded from child’s life events and are afraid of missing out on child’s growth and development.

TeddyBuddy is designed to make it easier to maintain an emotional bond with children remotely. For a child, chatting and playing with a concrete toy like object is easier than with computer or phone. Through TeddyBuddy distant adult has an opportunity to visit the child’s world letting the child invite them into their daily life. The adult can control Teddy’s head movements through touch screen, bringing flexibility to control the view. Camera’s Focus and zoom features makes it easier to follow child's movements and take part on games or activities remotely. With the help of Teddy, an adult can also be present at events outside home, such as a child's hobbies or family celebrations that they cannot be a part of physically.
