This project is exploring vibration as a haptic medium to mediate physical touch over distance. The aim of the project has been to create a design by combining the design strategies Awareness and Physicalness for mediating intimacy over distance in a touchable haptic device. The design consists of two remotely connected devices and explores the playfulness of searching over the surface to find the other's touch by receiving a feedback of vibration when the two users synchronously touch their devices on the same spot at the same time. Prototype testing revealed that the sensation of the vibration could be used as a meaningful haptic feedback as some intimacy was felt in the interaction. This project opens up for future possibilities to use vibration as a haptic tool when mediating intimacy over distance.
