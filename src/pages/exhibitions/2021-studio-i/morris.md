The aim of this project is to develop a platform that allows the stakeholders to further encourage a deeper engagement from their audiences compared to static media through interactive means, combining tactile and direct controls, dynamic visuals and evolving soundscapes to create something closer to an interactive experience than a “piece” of art, giving the user some control of what they see and hear but still within the boundries set by the stakeholders.
