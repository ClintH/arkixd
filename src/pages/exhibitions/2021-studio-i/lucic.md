Motivation can be defined as a driving force that leads people to want to act, perform, or do something. Understanding how the motivation of many athletes lays in their teammates/training partners, competing, and in rewards to an extent, this project focused on bringing athletes together and letting them motivate each other while working out together and competing. With the help of many athletes, the best methods for interactivity (both man-to-man and man-to-computer) have been produced.
