Based on the research that was conducted during the last course, remote working while using video calls is becoming more common. The goal of this design work is to enrich the experience of video chatting with the help of AI. The AI algorithm would register some information about the person sitting in front of the camera and send it to the person on the other side of the call. The initial design has three features, which are face detection, user attention to the screen and the emotion of the user. There is a possibility to add more features to the design in future versions.
