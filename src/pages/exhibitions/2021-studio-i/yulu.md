In pandemic, many employees report fatigue and low-engagement issues over video conferencing. Academia researchers have described that lack of synchrony and social cues are the main causes. This design work aims to unpack how people might sense body presence over video conferences. Elements are filters made from Augmented Reality on video conference tools. The aim is to unpack notions of maintaining professionalism over distance. Hopefully, this design work can inspire future work for a better distant teamwork experience.
