The design is an interface and a part-functioning Adobe XD prototype of a mobile device app called “Family Time”. The app helps separated families to connect and bond over a distance and the focus is put on strengthening relationships between grandchildren and grandparents. The design covers most of the main problems, which three-generation families encounter during scheduling, initiating and conducting video chats.

The idea for the software is based on using face recognition to create avatar-like previews for every family member, who is in the eyeshot of a camera. The app establishes a shared, adjustable space for the whole family to give them an experience close to being together in one place. “Family Time” offers playful interactions, games, book stories and educational exercises to avoid boredom, increase a role of grandparents in grandchildren’s lives and engage children in a conversation.

The app provides expanded control options for every person and device involved in a chat to allow helping children and elderly with problems and mistakes, which occur while using mobile devices. Child lock in a form of mathematical equations follows every attempt to change crucial functions and settings.

Users can save notes, snapshots, learning outcomes, game scores and drawings to keep memories and follow children’s development. Easy scheduling function with reminders facilitates arranging future videocalls, while the shared calendar makes it easier to remember about important family events.

The interface of the app is visually attractive and simple, with proper feedforwards and feedback, which seem natural even for less tech-savvy people. “Family Time” is both appealing to kids and accessible for older people. It supports building relationships and connecting over distance and generations.
