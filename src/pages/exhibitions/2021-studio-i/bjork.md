The process of improving one's footballing intelligence, more specifically spatial awareness, scanning, and decision making, individually, is not an easy one. In my project, I explored ways to improve football intelligence in a game-realistic way. Utilizing an augmented reality system and interacting with it, users are placed into game-like scenarios, forcing them to react and adapt to their surroundings quickly, much like in real-life football games.
