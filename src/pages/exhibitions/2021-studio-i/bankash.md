In recent years, young adult gamers have become socially isolated which altered their social development and decreased their social network. After doing my research, I concluded that isolation and decreased social networks among gamers might be related to the high incidences of depression and mental health distress among them. 

A scavenger hunt is a social game that is now played over distance. The app enables the players to build their team within their social network or play with an online team. It also gives players the choice between customizing their scavenger hunt or choosing a location where they prefer to hunt for clues. Players can team up to solve the riddles by communicating through chat, voice, or video call. When a clue is found, players scan the QR code to proceed to the next clue. After all riddles are solved, players receive points that they can exchange for real-life coupons and promotions. Based on the user testing outcome, an additional step counter is added to encourage gamers to take a walk. The more steps gamers make, the more hints they can unlock. In addition, a map is also added to view a marked area to users to indicate where the clue is so players donâ€™t end up looking far away from the clue.

Scavenger hunt game promotes team building, social and physical activity, encouraging gamers to go out more and interact with the outside world which in return improves their physical and mental health.
