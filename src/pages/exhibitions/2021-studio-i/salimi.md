Not having social interactions and bonds with people one works with, could be detrimental to oneâ€™s mental health as well as work performance. When working remotely, keeping in touch with your colleagues on a social and informal level gets hard. The present project introduces a new way of having social interactions for office workers when it is impossible for them to meet face-to-face with their co-workers. This design work suggests a separate digital space for having social and informal chatters for individuals in a team/department, including features that have been designed to encourage office workers to use this tool, create a sense of belonging, make the interaction easier, etc. This design has been inspired by the concept of conversation pieces and the program Wonder.
