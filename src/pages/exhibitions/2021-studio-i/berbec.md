A study on the illusion of control and its reinforcement through physical interaction. An experiment involving a game of dice, physical and computerised, where 10 participants have been set up to examine people’s reactions and gain some insight views about how users perceive their notion of control during physical- and computer-interaction. This study demonstrated principles of relationship between interaction attribute and emerging experience and observed which factors influenced the perception of involvement and skill opposed to which elements of an interaction which may cause feelings of disconnection between the user and the outcome of said interaction.
