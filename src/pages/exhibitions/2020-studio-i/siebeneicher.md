NFC has over the last decade found its way into most smartphones and is often used for contactless payment or pairing of Bluetooth devices. These use cases however only illustrate one out of three modes that NFC can operate in. To better understand the properties and limitations of NFC and especially the peer-to-peer mode inspirational bits are presented. Through two different inspirational bits limitations like manual user interference and properties like the range of the signal are highlighted and made into tangible experiences.
