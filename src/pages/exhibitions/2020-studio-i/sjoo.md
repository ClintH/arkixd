What if one could manipulate a fictitious space confined within a real object? This project set out to explore if sound as material could be used to create such a fictitious space and what insights it could produce. A set of experiments and explorations with different sets of qualities has been conducted to gather insights. Instead of using different material samples, I chose to explore and build a box that utilizes different material qualities that are bound to the physical object itself, in the form of different sounds coupled with embodied interactions such as tilting the object.
