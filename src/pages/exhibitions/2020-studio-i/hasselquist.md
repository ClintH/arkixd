Keys open doors, passwords unlock your phone and personal identity numbers are used as identification. There are however, opportunities to utilize bodily features already at hand instead of relaying on digits or pieces of metal that are easy to crack and forge. Fingerprint-readers and iris-scanners are already in use as means of identification, however there are more bodily features that are unique to each person. In this project I have explored what it would look like if your ECG, sweat or saliva was used as means of identification and verification, and in what situations they could be used.
