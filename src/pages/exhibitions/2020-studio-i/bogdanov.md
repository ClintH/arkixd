It may sound a bit eccentric to some people to ‘dissect’ the topic of video games as a part of the field of interaction design, since usually the biggest goal of playing games is entertainment. However, I decided to focus on the embodiment aspect of the gaming experience and more concrete the gestures in first person shooter games. As I conducted multiple experiments, I came up with some potential new hand and fingers gestures that could be implemented to enhance the gaming experience.
