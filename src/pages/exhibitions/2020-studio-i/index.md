Welcome to the Studio-1, end-of-year exhibition!

Our first year students in Interaction Design present the outcomes of a short individual design project on a self-chosen topic within one of three categories:

 - exploring what an interaction **designer’s material** could be
 - (re)designing a **design method**
 - bringing **aesthetic notions** to life in design elements

This is a brand new course, in a new end-of-year format with a new variety of works, and our education’s first on-line exhibition with visitors. Come to chat with our students and let them show their concrete work.
