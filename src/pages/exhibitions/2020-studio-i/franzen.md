Understanding how we can use ML as a design material to create interactive experiences can be tricky, so I explored different interactive modalities with ML before narrowing it down to gestures. Through three samples of ML with gestures, we unpack and get a look into understanding ML as a material in compound with a modality. Further, the samples show and communicate what otherwise can be hard to grasp in only descriptive terms. I hope these samples inspire and further encourages exploration of ML in playful ways.
