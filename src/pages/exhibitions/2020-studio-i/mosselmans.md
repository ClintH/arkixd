Ambient Displays are a kind of information display inspired by ubiquitous computing. An important characteristic of these displays is that they can move seamlessly from background to foreground, meaning that they are able to understand when it should be in the user's periphery and when it should call to their attention. Inspired by previous Ambient Display design work, the experiments conducted in this Studio Course were designed to test where the limits of background and foreground lie and how they can inform future design.
