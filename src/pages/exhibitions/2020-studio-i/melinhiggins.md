The human is a visual creature meaning we process visual data better than any other type data. With this being said, there are still good and bad data visualisations that will be processed by the viewer in different ways. This project has been about exploring how aesthetic interaction plays a role in what the user experiences when interacting with a chart and what effect this has on the communication of data.
