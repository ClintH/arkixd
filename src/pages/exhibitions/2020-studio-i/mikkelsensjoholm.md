I’m exploring light as a material. How to control the light in a 3D space and steering the eye’s attention in different ways. With the help of simple 3D spaces and prototypes built out of cardboard boxes I’m playing with how light is shown and how it affects the surroundings. With the lights properties of being able to chang and re-shap quickly it’s a great recourse that I believe is underestimated.
