The most important part in design process for interaction designers is the ideation part, where designers start to sketch their ideas and annotate over it. Annotation can be used in many different ways, so I want to show how can designers use it and how it can be helpful to understand the concept. There are different ways to use annotation so I will try out different situations that are related to interaction design.
