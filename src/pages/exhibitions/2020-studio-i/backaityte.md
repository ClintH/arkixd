The aim of this project is to explore our interaction with everyday household objects and discourse over how comfort as an interaction in itself shapes our feelings towards objects. The project consists of multiple experiments I’ve conducted, which mainly focus on: 1) Me trying to understand the objects, experimenting with their material qualities; 2) Substituting the materials and observing the changes; 3) Experimenting with interaction as means for comfort.
