Played in darkness, _Superdeep Borehole_ is an audio-based game.

A helmet is worn that blocks out light. LEDs and a vibrating disc give feedback, but it is mostly an auditory experience.

To progress, the player must tap a tempo demanded by the level. A custom controller was designed for this purpose.
