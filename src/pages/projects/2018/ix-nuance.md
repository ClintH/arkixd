Type is everywhere in user interfaces but meaning is usually carried in the words themselves, or to a lesser extent, using colour to signal error or unavailability. If we accept that type is a necessary part of interfaces, could we use it to be more expressive?

In this three-week module, students explored providing nuanced, non-symbolic feedback through the use of variable typefaces.  

Variable typefaces are a new type technology that allows continuous manipulation in various axes. In collaboration with <a href="http://goransoderstrom.se/">Göran Söderström</a>, type designer and founder of <a href="https://lettersfromsweden.se/">Letters from Sweden</a>.

In the course <em>Interactivity</em>, students purposefully do not create concepts or solve problems, they are engaged with pure experimentation and building knowledge through design. A large quantity of sketches are produced, here we draw out a handful.

# Feedforward
## Piotr Kruszynski

These sketches use type to indicate that an element can be swiped from left to right. The expression suggests that each element demands a different kind of swipe gesture.z

# Movement
## Julia Brandt & Taner Olcay

These sketches show type being modulated by physical objects. Using simple computer vision, the sketches respond to movement by brightly coloured objects.

# Urgency
## Benjamin Dannegård & Line Göst

Exploring feedback of temporal events. In this case, suggesting whether one should hurry or not to catch a bus. In the sketch, the horizontal movement of the cursor controls the 'urgency'.

# Typing
## Alexander Grövnes & Lucas Stenberg

An expressive typewriter embodies the characteristics of typing in the text it leaves behind. In this sketch, the per-letter speed of typing is used to modulate the font.

# Space
## Kristina Arnold & Johan Hellgren

Text is arranged and subtly modulated according to distance and direction of landmarks creating a dynamic typographical map.

# Action
## Theo Nordahl & Anna Wahl

Two sketches here demonstrate some of the explorations of time. The first shows how a calendar might visually show the 'heaviness' of appointments for each date. The second second shows a wayfinding cue suggesting to a festival goer the direction and activity of a stage.
