Promoting trading of locally produced food is one way to challenge the more conventional way of producing food while contributing to a more sustainable consumption. Through empirical research and design practice closely related to its users, this study has explored the motivational aspects behind trading within the platform and concept of REKO-ring Malm√∂. An analysis of the existing service in relation to its producers and consumers has been made to formulate problems related to how the platform works today. The study results in a design proposal of a new digital platform that shows improvement in meeting the needs and expectations of the consumers found during the empirical research.
