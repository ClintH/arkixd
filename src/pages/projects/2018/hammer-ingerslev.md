This paper explores the field of museum interactions with a specific focus on the introduction of smell as a means to communicate the objects on display and create more memorable museum visits. Through literature, research, focus groups, and a substantial ideation phase I have found problems and design openings in the exhibition room. These, I have addressed by creating and testing a set of three olfactory display prototypes in the exhibition, all with a scent fitting not only the objects but also the exhibition room as a whole. The introduction of these interactive olfactory displays has resulted in a change in how the exhibition was perceived and what the visitors took with them from the experience. This is an exploration into a new and unknown field, contributing to the field of museums as well as the general field of smell interaction in space. It is also an exploration into how museum visits can be made more memorable by using the incredible ability of smells to spark associations and memories.
