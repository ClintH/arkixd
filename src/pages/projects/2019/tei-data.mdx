As we spend more time in virtual environments, we see an opportunity in researching alternative ways of presenting information from a digital world to accommodate the increased output of data. Most virtual environments rely on visual and auditory feedback in order to interact with a user. Therefore, we have created a prototype for a multimodal interface that utilizes visual, auditory, haptic and olfactory feedback as a means to communicate information from the virtual world of Minecraft. Our work includes multiple prototyping iterations and two user testing sessions, in hopes of finding an intuitive correlation between the digital information and the presented feedback. We believe that our findings can be applied to other virtual environments
