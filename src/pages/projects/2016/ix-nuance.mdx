In this two-week exploration, students investigated how to create nuanced action in relation to screen interaction.

<div className="narrow section">

# Scrolling
## Oskar Hansson

<MauVideo id="0_qje8gabf" />

<div className="narrow section">

# Tilt Paint
## Linn Nerlund, Johanne Radford

<MauVideo id="0_7uy6qzs8" />
