![Overview of the setup](zomer-1.jpg)

Five principles for shaping proactive interaction

1. Define the artefact’s purpose and the user’s expectations. 
2. Balance feedback both in terms of means and timeframe (frequency).
3. Consider spatial implications in relation to utilized means of feedback.
4. Revisit the notion of gaining versus losing 
control.
5. Explore the concept of annoyance as a design 
material, and the human-artefact relationship.
