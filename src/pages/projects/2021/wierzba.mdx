This thesis explores how non-visual modalities, especially gestures, can be utilized to enhance user experience. In collaboration with an industry partner, this work is anchored in an existing multiscreen, cross-device product. Through prototyping an co-creation with participants, a gesture taxonomy is proposed for this particular context.
