_The Memory Bank_ is a physical brain training game, acting within the scenario of a bank robbery. You are inside of a bank and your task is to either protect the safe or break into it. You do this by memorising the number combination shown to you on the display of the safe and then repeat it back using the different interactive tools attached to the doors. The combinations and interactions change and get harder each time you succeed and your goal is to open the third and last safe before your opponent.
