In collaboration with the city of Malmö, students in the _Service Design_ course investigated the issue of food waste in facilities such as kindergartens and elderly care homes.

Students conducted their projects in a co-design manner, including extensive fieldwork and prototyping and a roadmap for how to deploy the concepts.
