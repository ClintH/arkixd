Pompom is an interactive system designed to aid children in musical and visual expression. It combines an on-screen interface and a physical artifact offering children an opportunity to express themselves creatively. The intent with this project was to integrate tangible and embodied interactions within music to explore what role these interactions play for musical and visual expression for children between five and eight.
